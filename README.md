# aliases

Simple aliases for working with git, rails and node

### Instalation ###
Simply open up your ~/.bash_profile and copy/paste the raw scripts in or:
* Download the script you wish to include
* vi ~/.bash_profile
* add 'source path/to/script' to your bash_profile

Reload your terminal and you're good to go.

(If you're not using bash_profile, repeat these steps changing ~/.bash_profile to your profiling script source)
